HOW TO RUN THE APP 
1. As on now I have not made it public for facebook. Only I will be able to login to my facebook. 
2. If you want to test the app then we need to skip the Facebook login. 

Step One: Go to Manifest and change the main launch activity from .MainActivity to .NavigationActivity
Step Two: Comment out the NavigationActivity at the bottom on Manifest file

Now you will be able to test the rest of the app. 

I worked extremely hard this week and put in over 50 hours logged on my milestone two. I have 90% of my milestone done. Just need to tweak on a few things a little. I already fixed the couple issues I have having during my presentation.
