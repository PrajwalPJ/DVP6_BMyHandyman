You can run this on any API

The only thing you will get to test out is the Facebook Login button. I have not worked on the design aspect. First step is my functionality then I can do all the design. 

Facebook button is done. 

You can also see that I am working on my profile page if you click on my layout and click activity_profile

That is what I have for milestone one.
