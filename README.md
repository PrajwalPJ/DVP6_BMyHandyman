HOW TO RUN THE APP

There is honestly a lot that went on this week. I literally had to start back up from milestone one and go through each user story and functionality and make sure it’s perfect. I spent a lot of time fixing many things from day one. One example is the profile page I went back and removed the data I cannot pull from the Facebook and firebase database. Facebook only allows permissions for so many fields. Now it’s so much smoother pulling from the database. 

I spent mad amount of time trying to save an image to the firebase database for the verification feature. I had to convert the image into a url and then store that in the storage reference. Then I must get access to that to check if it is not empty and then do a check for the button to change color to green and change the text to verified. I had to use an interface to make that happen. It was just a mess now I can do it easily for the future. 

I have about 30 hours this week logged and most of it is coding. Overall have over 100 hours on this project. I over scoped the project but it is amazing to see that I got it all done. I have all my database done and fully functional as well. 
	
I also had the app tested by 3 different people and with their feedback changed many things and each time I made changed I updated it on my Github. The app is currently public and I handled that on Facebook developer console. 

I worked hard and I got everything done in fact more than what I planned for and I am satisfied with my work. 

BUGS: I have had 3 users test it and run it so there should not be any bugs.
